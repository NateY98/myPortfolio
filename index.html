          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi I'm Nate, a Front-End Web Developer based out of Oakville and a
            recent graduate of Juno College of Technology. Additionally, I have
            a Honors Bachelor of Arts from the University of Toronto and a
            certificate of digital communications from Sheridan College. As an
            individual that loves to learn, I am always challenging myself to
            stay on top of new tools and web-development content. When it comes
            to development and design, my goal is to create applications that
            are responsive, accessible, creative and minimalistic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from coding, I enjoy watching and playing sports, playing
            video games, traveling, and photography.

              I don't play the piano... but you can! Play your favourite song
              using your keyboard, mouse or finger. Pian&sup2;o allows users to
              play any song they want as long as they can keep it within one
              octave. Audio files are saved on Firebase Storage and a specific
              file is called based on which key is pressed.

            <h3>Ask Zoltan</h3>
            <p>
              Need advice? Ask Zoltan. A totally unique fortune telling app that
              totally isn't based off a machine... Part of an agency styled
              assignment, the objective of this project was to create an app
              that matched the request of a client. This app allows users to
              enter a keyword which will return a piece of advice back to them
              from the Advice Slip API once they have completed solving a maze.
